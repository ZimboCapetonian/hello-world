# hello-world
This is my first every repository (when I have been serious about learning to code)! 
I am learning code for multiple reasons. Too keep myself occupied while taking a break from my studies, learning an indemand skill to better my future and finally because I have always wanted to.

Now I am doing a bootcamp program, as well as finishing up my fCC first certificate projects
